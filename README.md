# Simple Forum
It is a simple forum application. Everyone can add message to the forum anonymously.
It uses sqlite3 to stores the messages. It uses a paging mechanism. It uses express.js.
This was developed in 2021 summer. I didn't know much technnical stuffs at the time.
If I have time, I would use websocket so the user can see instant change in the forum,
add use infinite scroll instead.

# RUN
```node index.js```

and open the browser and goto localhost:8080/index.html
